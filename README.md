  title: "Block-Talk: Enhanced Decentralized Chat System"
  type: "Team Research Project"
  portfolio_copy: "https://github.com/CYBER-STARK/CryptoComm"
  overview: "Block-Talk is a decentralized messaging system designed to provide secure, scalable, and privacy-preserving communication. It uses blockchain architecture to implement mutual-consent connections, end-to-end encryption, and decentralized media storage."
  my_contributions:
    - "Collaborated with the team on designing system architecture and feature implementation"
    - "Developed modules for message handling and request-response logic"
    - "Documented features and shared code with team members for seamless integration"
  features:
    - "Mutual-consent request-response model for secure connections"
    - "Client-side end-to-end encryption using AES-256-GCM"
    - "Decentralized media storage using IPFS and on-chain cryptographic hashes"
    - "Scalable architecture suitable for social communication platforms"
  technologies_used:
    blockchain_smart_contracts: "Solidity"
    backend_server: "Node.js, Express.js"
    decentralized_storage: "IPFS (Lighthouse)"
    encryption: "AES-256-GCM, PBKDF2 key derivation"
    frontend_client: "HTML, CSS, JavaScript"
